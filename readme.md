## Homebrew Helper

Not putting much here right now since this is a WIP. If you have feature requests, open up a new issue. I'll organize the code nicely soon enough.

For now the only proper feature in it is the dice roll.
## What is bot?
 Bot is a software application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet. Typically, bots perform tasks that are simple and repetitive, much faster than a person could. The most extensive use of bots is for web crawling, in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers. More than half of all web traffic is generated by bots.
 ## Status of this Project
 Bot can do lots of things, but as now this project contains the fuctionality of roll dice only.
